//I am planning on taking cupcakes to my local elementary school in honor of thanksgiving.
//Calculate the average amount of cupcakes needed for each classroom 

Calculate(20, 19, 16); //This represents the number of students in 3 seperate classrooms
function Calculate(n1, n2, n3) { 
  var average = (n1 +  n2 + n3) / 3 //formula to calculate the average cupcakes per class
 console.log(average); 
}
