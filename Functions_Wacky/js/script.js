//I am planning on taking cupcakes to my local elementary school in honor of thanksgiving.
//Calculate the average amount of cupcakes needed for each classroom 

Calculate(20, 19, 16); //This represents the number of students in 3 seperate classrooms
function Calculate(n1, n2, n3) { //Here I am setting the parameters that will go along with the arguments above
 var average = (n1 +  n2 + n3) / 3; 
 console.log("The average cupcakes you will need per classroom is "+ average + "."); 
 
//The variable "average" calcualtes the average amount of students per class, hence, the average amount of 
//cupcakes I should bring to school
//console. log prints out results for developer to view
